# Neural Networks from Scratch in Python

Welcome to my **Neural Networks from Scratch in Python** project! This repository showcases a bare-metal implementation of neural networks, constructed without the aid of external deep learning libraries. By building each component from the ground up, I've aimed to demystify the inner workings of neural networks and provide a transparent view of their mechanics.

## Technical Overview

- **Pure Python Implementation**: The entire neural network is developed using Python, ensuring clarity and simplicity in understanding the foundational concepts.
- **NumPy Integration**: While the core implementation avoids third-party libraries, NumPy is incorporated in later stages to enhance numerical computations and performance.
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured into distinct modules, each representing a fundamental aspect of neural networks, including:
  - **Neurons and Layers**: Basic building blocks of the network.
  - **Activation Functions**: Implementations of various activation mechanisms.
  - **Loss Calculations**: Methods to evaluate network performance.
  - **Backpropagation**: Algorithm for training the network through error correction.
  - **Optimization Techniques**: Strategies to improve learning efficiency.
